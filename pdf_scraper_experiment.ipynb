      "v ForewordForeword Foreword It is unequivocal that human activities have heated our climate.\n",
      "Recent changes are rapid, intensifying, and unprecedented over centuries to thousands of years.\n",
      "With each additional increment of warming, these changes will become larger, resulting in long-lasting, irreversible implications, in particular for sea level rise.\n",
      "United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has stated that ‘the evidence is irrefutable’ and ‘we see the warning signs in every continent and region’.\n",
      "The Working Group I contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report provides a reality check on climate change.\n",
      "We now have a much clearer picture of the past, present and possible future climates, and this information is essential for understanding where we are headed, what can be done, and the multiple facets of a changing climate to prepare for, in every region.\n",
      "Unless deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades, global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels will be exceeded during the 21st century.\n",
      "The new Working Group I Report structure integrates multiple lines of scientific evidence within each chapter and provides robust knowledge relevant for policymaking through the end-to-end assessment of key topics.\n",
      "This more holistic approach has resulted in a report that provides a better understanding of the climate system, for both past and future changes, with a new emphasis on climate information for regions, which is critical for informing adaptation and risk management strategies.\n",
      "Today, many decisions remain grounded in the experience of past climate variability.\n",
      "This report provides a solid basis for taking into account future changes that need to be considered in today’s decisions, with increased relevance for climate services, to enhance adaptation and resilience to climate change and curb greenhouse gas emissions.The journey of this report reflects extraordinary efforts by all contributors under exceptional circumstances.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic, which started during the review of the Second Order Draft, disrupted the process.\n",
      "However, the early response of Working Group I, through the hard work of the authors, review editors, chapter scientists, the Technical Support Unit, and Bureau members, made it possible to deliver a report that meets the most stringent science quality standards, thanks to the in-depth, broad review process, with an exhaustive, robust, rigorous and transparent assessment of the latest state of climate science knowledge.\n",
      "We commend the additional efforts taken, including by all reviewers from the research community and government representatives who adapted to a new way of working to complete this vital report.\n",
      "Our particular appreciation goes to the Working Group I Co-Chairs Valérie Masson-Delmotte and Panmao Zhai for their leadership throughout the process.\n",
      "Their extraordinary efforts ensured that this robust and clear report is available to the world today.\n",
      "This Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report covers important new advances in climate science that provide an invaluable input into climate negotiations and decision- making, with an emphasis on key conditions that, from a physical science basis, are needed to limit global warming and inform risk assessment and regional adaptation.\n",
      "The report was welcomed at the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n",
      "It will also inform the 2023 global stocktake.\n",
      "Unless there are deep reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, the goal of limiting warming well below 2°C and close to 1.5°C will be out of reach.\n",
      "The science is unequivocal, the changes are unprecedented, and there is no more time for delay.\n",

      "vii PrefacePreface Preface 1 Global warming of 1.5°C: an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC).The Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) focuses on a full and comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate change, based on evidence from more than 14,000 scientific publications available by 31 January 2021.\n",
      "This Report reflects recent climate science advances resulting from progress in, and the integration of, multiple lines of evidence, including: in situ and remote observations; paleoclimate information; understanding of climate drivers and physical, chemical and biological processes and feedbacks; and global and regional climate modelling; as well as advances in methods of analyses and insights from the growing field of climate services.\n",
      "The AR6 WGI Report builds on the WGI contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2013, and the AR6 Special Reports1 released in 2018 and 2019.\n",
      "The report considers the current state of the climate in the long-term context, the understanding of human influence, the state of knowledge about possible climate futures, climate information relevant for climate-related risk assessment and regional adaptation, and the physical science basis on limiting human-induced climate change.\n",
      "Scope of the Report As part of the scoping process and approval of the outline of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, the WGI contribution evolved from the structure of past WGI assessment reports, reflecting developments in climate science and the assessment of global and regional climate information that is relevant to inform decision-making.\n",
      "Some key new topics assessed by WGI include the global response to new illustrative emissions scenarios, physical climate storylines, low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes, and physical climate conditions that affect society and/or ecosystems (defined as climatic impact-drivers).\n",
      "The integration of multiple lines of evidence strengthens the understanding of past, current and possible future changes in the climate system and the distillation of regional climate change information at regional scale.\n",
      "The new structure of the WGI Report is designed to facilitate this integration for end-to-end assessment of key topics and to enhance the visibility of knowledge developments for global and regional climate change.\n",
      "This includes climate information that is relevant for risk assessment, regional adaptation and for mitigation.\n",
      "It is also designed to inform decision-making without being policy prescriptive and to facilitate the integration of the WGI key findings with the other AR6 Working Group reports.\n",
      "Structure of the Report This Report consists of thirteen thematic chapters with their supporting supplementary material, ten annexes (including the report Glossary, which is developed in coordination with Working Groups II and III where relevant), an integrative Technical Summary, and a Summary for Policymakers.\n",
      "An innovation in this Working Group I assessment is the online Interactive Atlas (https://interactive-atlas.\n",
      "ipcc.ch), a novel tool for flexible spatial and temporal analyses of observed and projected climate change information, which enhances accessibility for stakeholders and users to the data assessed in the Report.\n",
      "The Summary for Policymakers and Technical Summary include the line of sight, indicated in curly brackets, to the chapters and the specific sections therein where the detailed assessment can be found.\n",
      "In this way, these summary components of the Report provide a roadmap to the contents of the entire report and a synthesis of the major findings that is traceable to the underlying literature and assessment.\n",
      "The introduction (Chapter 1) of the Report frames the WGI assessment within the broader AR6 and global climate policy context and introduces the key concepts, lines of evidence, and major developments.\n",
      "The remainder of the Report is structured in three segments.\n",
      "The first segment focuses on large-scale climate change (Chapters 2–4).\n",
      "These chapters provide an updated and comprehensive assessment of knowledge about the current state of the climate system, human influence and projections of future change on key large-scale indicators of the climate system.\n",
      "Chapter 2 assesses observed large-scale changes in the climate system in the long-term paleoclimate context.\n",
      "Chapter 3 updates the assessment of human influence on the climate system, considering natural variability, model performance and detection and attribution.\n",
      "Chapter 4 covers global climate projections spanning time horizons from the near term (2021–2040) to the mid-term (2041–2060), long term (2081–2100) and beyond.\n",
      "The second segment of the report is dedicated to climate system components and processes that play key roles in global and regional climate (Chapters 5–9), including carbon and other biogeochemical cycles, energy, and water; short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) and their link to air quality; and changes in the ocean, cryosphere and sea level.\n",
      "Chapter 5 addresses the assessment of the global biogeochemical budgets for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous\n",
      "viii PrefacePreface oxide and the assessment of carbon and other biogeochemical feedbacks.\n",
      "Chapter 6 assesses changes in the emissions and abundances of individual SLCFs, how these changes affect Earth’s energy balance through radiative forcing and feedback in the climate system, the implications of changing climate on air quality, and the implications of SLCF mitigation for climate and for air quality.\n",
      "Chapter 7 addresses Earth’s energy budget through advances in observations, understanding and quantification of effective radiative forcing, and the assessment of feedbacks and climate sensitivity.\n",
      "Chapter 8 assesses observed and projected changes in the global water cycle, the physical understanding of the complexity of its response to multiple drivers, and implications for water availability.\n",
      "The physical processes underlying global and regional changes in the ocean, cryosphere and sea level and the understanding of observed and projected future changes since the AR5 and Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate are assessed in Chapter 9.\n",
      "The final four chapters of the Report (Chapters 10–12 and the Atlas) are dedicated to the assessment and distillation of regional climate information from multiple lines of evidence at sub-continental to local scales (including urban climate), building on information from previous chapters on large-scale climate and process understanding, with a focus on recent and projected regional changes in mean climate, extremes, and climatic impact-drivers.\n",
      "Chapter 10 assesses the foundations of how regional climate information is distilled from multiple lines of evidence and the interplay between anthropogenic causes and internal variability at regional scales.\n",
      "Chapter 11 addresses changes in weather and climate extremes on global and regional scales, including observed changes and their attribution, as well as projected changes.\n",
      "Chapter 12 assesses the climatic conditions that may lead to impacts and risks across the world’s regions.\n",
      "Changes in mean climate at regional scales, in particular observed trends and their attribution and projected future changes in temperature and precipitation, are assessed in the Atlas chapter.\n",
      "The Interactive Atlas allows flexible spatial and temporal analyses of climate variables, extreme indices and climatic impact-drivers, including datasets underpinning assessment findings across report chapters and syntheses of regional changes.\n",
      "Specific regional case studies are considered in different chapters, including rainfall changes in the Sahel and Western Africa, South-Western North America, and South-Eastern South America; climate information relevant for water resources in small islands, for Cape Town drought, for the Indian summer monsoon, for Mediterranean summer warming, and for the Hindu Kush Himalaya region; urban climate processes and trends; and the influence of the Arctic on mid-latitude climate.\n",
      "All chapters contain Frequently Asked Questions, which are grounded in the assessment and written in language that is more accessible to a broad readership and can serve as a resource for teaching and outreach.\n",
      "Each chapter is accompanied by Supplementary Material, which is available online and provides traceability and transparency for technical aspects of the assessment, such as descriptions of datasets, models or methodologies supporting chapter analyses.\n",
      "The Process This WGI Assessment Report represents the combined efforts of hundreds of leading experts in the field of climate science and has been prepared in accordance with principles and procedures of the IPCC.\n",
      "A scoping meeting for the Sixth Assessment Report was held in May 2017, and the outlines for the contributions of the three Working Groups were approved at the 46th Session of the Panel in September 2017.\n",
      "Governments and IPCC observer organizations nominated experts for the author team.\n",
      "The team of 198 Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors plus 36 Review Editors selected by the WGI Bureau was accepted at the 55th Session of the IPCC Bureau in January 2018.\n",
      "During the report preparation, a few changes have taken place to address core expertise gaps and to replace authors who were not available anymore.\n",
      "In addition, 615 Contributing Authors provided information to the author teams at their request.\n",
      "Drafts prepared by the authors were subject to two rounds of formal review and revision followed by a final round of government comments on the Summary for Policymakers.\n",
      "A total of 78,007 written review comments were submitted by 1891 individual expert reviewers and 47 governments.\n",
      "The Review Editors for each chapter monitored the review process to ensure that all review comments received appropriate consideration.\n",
      "All review comments and responses are available online on the report website.\n",
      "Three in-person Lead Author Meetings took place to enhance progress and coordination in the assessment process.\n",
      "These were particularly critical for the intense cross-chapter coordination implied by the new report outline.\n",
      "We strived to foster an inclusive environment that achieves a rigorous and transparent assessment process.\n",
      "These efforts included greater attention to addressing implicit biases and technical considerations to enhance the participation in the process and increasing the accessibility of the assessed information.\n",
      "For the first time in the IPCC, WGI recommended the implementation of FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles in the assessment to document and curate the data assessed and included in report figures.\n",
      "The motivation was to increase transparency and accessibility of the assessment, support implementation of the IPCC Error Protocol, and provide for the long-term curation of the assessed digital information.\n",
      "This process was supported by our close collaboration with the IPCC Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data) established in March 2018.\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization at the start the Second Order Draft review.\n",
      "Following an extensive consultation process with IPCC member countries, authors and the scientific community, including editors of relevant\n",
      "ix PrefacePreface science journals, the timeline of the report was extended by four months to balance the delays and challenges faced by authors and the scientific community with maintaining momentum and timeliness in the assessment process.\n",
      "The review process is critical for the rigor, objectivity and comprehensiveness of the assessment.\n",
      "The adjustments to the timeline facilitated broad participation from scientists and governments in the review process.\n",
      "Stringent scientific rigor and quality of the assessment were maintained despite the pandemic.\n",
      "The fourth Lead Author Meeting, due to be held in June 2020, was replaced by extensive virtual activities to address the Second Order Draft review comments and topics that cut across multiple chapters.\n",
      "A final virtual Lead Author Meeting was held in February 2021 to finalize the report.\n",
      "Drafting meetings for the Summary for Policymakers also took place through virtual meetings.\n",
      "Addressing the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assessment process required innovation to facilitate international virtual collaboration, including extra support and training for participants and facilitators, support for participants with internet connectivity challenges, additional advance preparation, shorter and more focused meetings with clear agendas and objectives and duplicated to account for time zones of participants, high levels of transparency – including the provision of written summaries of meetings and decisions, and allotting time for asynchronous contributions to the discussion and decision-making process.\n",
      "Documenting and understanding barriers to participation due to an increased reliance on online activities and the use of inclusive practices required priority attention in these novel conditions.\n",
      "We gained experience in applying methods to facilitate participatory and inclusive processes in the assessment and recognized the necessity of fostering these approaches over the course of the assessment process, both during and in-between meetings, to build a stronger community of practice within this unique international context.\n",
      "This will be an important legacy for future assessment cycles.\n",
      "The preparation of the WGI AR6 report was also informed by recommendations from several IPCC expert meetings.\n",
      "The first meeting focused on assessing climate information for regions (in 2018, co-organized by WGI and WGII, and hosted at ICTP , Trieste, Italy), which provided a scoping of the Interactive Atlas.\n",
      "A second meeting focused on short-lived climate forcers (in 2018, co-organized by TFI and WGI, and hosted by the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, Switzerland), which identified science advances in the understanding of emissions and climate effects of SLCFs and needs for improvements in emission inventories and methodologies.\n",
      "A third meeting on mitigation, sustainability, and climate stabilization scenarios (in 2019, organized by WGIII in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), led to cross-WG coordination related to scenarios.\n",
      "Recommendations for clarity and readability from the 2016 IPCC Expert Meeting on Communication (organized by the IPCC Secretariat in Oslo, Norway) were taken into account in developing technical guidance, training and resources provided to authors and in particular for the preparation of the text and figures of the Frequently Asked Questions and the Summary for Policymakers.The Summary for Policymakers was approved line-by-line during the first-ever virtual IPCC approval session, the 14th Session of IPCC Working Group I from 26 July – 06 August 2021, and the underlying Report was accepted during the 54th Session of the IPCC on the 6th August 2021.\n",
      "Acknowledgements We are very grateful for the exceptional rigor and dedication of the volunteer Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors throughout this process, who delivered the most comprehensive assessment ever of our physical understanding of climate change.\n",
      "We thank the Review Editors for working alongside the author teams to ensure that the chapters are fully reflective of the input provided through the review process.\n",

      "The report builds upon the 2013 Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the 2018–2019 IPCC Special Reports2 of the AR6 cycle and incorporates subsequent new evidence from climate science.3 This SPM provides a high-level summary of the understanding of the current state of the climate, including how it is changing and the role of human influence, the state of knowledge about possible climate futures, climate information relevant to regions and sectors, and limiting human-induced climate change.\n",
      "Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of confidence indicated using the IPCC calibrated language.4 The scientific basis for each key finding is found in chapter sections of the main Report and in the integrated synthesis presented in the Technical Summary (hereafter TS), and is indicated in curly brackets.\n",

      "It is very likely that well-mixed GHGs were the main driver12 of tropospheric warming since 1979 and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of cooling of the lower stratosphere between 1979 and the mid-1990s.\n",

      "38 Technical Summary TSIntroduction The Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) assesses the physical science basis of climate change.\n",
      "As part of that contribution, this Technical Summary (TS) is designed to bridge between the comprehensive assessment of the WGI Chapters and its Summary for Policymakers (SPM).\n",
      "It is primarily built from the Executive Summaries of the individual chapters and Atlas and provides a synthesis of key findings based on multiple lines of evidence (e.g., analyses of observations, models, paleoclimate information and understanding of physical, chemical and biological processes and components of the climate system).\n",
      "All the findings and figures here are supported by and traceable to the underlying chapters, with relevant chapter sections indicated in curly brackets.\n",
      "Throughout this Technical Summary, key assessment findings are reported using the IPCC calibrated uncertainty language (Chapter 1, Box 1.1).\n",
      "Two calibrated approaches are used to communicate the degree of certainty in key findings, which are based on author teams’ evaluations of underlying scientific understanding: 1) Confidence1 is a qualitative measure of the validity of a finding, based on the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement.\n",
      "2) Likelihood2 provides a quantified measure of confidence in a finding expressed probabilistically (e.g., based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgement by the author team or from a formal quantitative survey of expert views, or both).\n",
      "Where there is sufficient scientific confidence, findings can also be formulated as statements of fact without uncertainty qualifiers.\n",
      "Throughout IPCC reports, the calibrated language is clearly identified by being typeset in italics.\n",
      "The context and progress in climate science (Section TS.1) is followed by a Cross-Section Box TS.1 on global surface temperature change.\n",
      "Section TS.2 provides information about past and future large- scale changes in all components of the climate system.\n",
      "Section 1 In this Technical Summary, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high.\n",
      "A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence.\n",
      "For a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence (see Chapter 1, Box 1.1 for more details).\n",
      "2 In this Technical Summary, the following terms are used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%.\n",
      "Additional terms (extremely likely: 95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, and extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate.\n",
      "Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely (see Chapter 1, Box 1.1 for more details).\n",
      "Throughout the WGI report and unless stated otherwise, uncertainty is quantified using 90% uncertainty intervals.\n",
      "The 90% uncertainty interval, reported in square brackets [x to y], is estimated to have a 90% likelihood of covering the value that is being estimated.\n",
      "The range encompasses the median value, and there is an estimated 10% combined likelihood of the value being below the lower end of the range (x) and above its upper end (y).\n",
      "Often, the distribution will be considered symmetric about the corresponding best estimate, but this is not always the case.\n",
      "In this Report, an assessed 90% uncertainty interval is referred to as a ‘ very likely range’.\n",
      "Similarly, an assessed 66% uncertainty interval is referred to as a ‘ likely range’.\n",
      "3 The regional traceback matrices that provide the location of the assessment findings synthesized in Section TS.4 are in the Supplementary Material (SM) of Chapter 10.\n",
      "4 Data archive is available at https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/3234e9111d4f4354af00c3aaecd879b7.\n",
      "5 https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/ 6 The AR6 figures use one of the following approaches.\n",
      "For observations, the absence of ‘x’ symbols shows areas with statistical significance, while the presence of ‘x’ indicates non-significance.\n",
      "For model projections, the method offers two approaches with varying complexity.\n",
      "In the simple approach, high agreement (≥80%) is indicated with no overlay, and diagonal lines (///) show low agreement (<80%); In the advanced approach, areas with no overlay display robust signal (≥66% of models show change greater than the variability threshold and ≥80% of all models agree on the sign of change), reverse diagonal lines (\\\\\\) show no robust signal, and crossed lines show conflicting signals (i.e., significant change but low agreement).\n",
      "Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1 provides more information on the AR6 method for visualizing robustness and uncertainty on maps.TS.3 summarizes knowledge and understanding of climate forcings, feedbacks and responses.\n",
      "Infographic TS.1 uses a storyline approach to integrate findings on possible climate futures.\n",
      "Finally, Section TS.4 provides a synthesis of climate information at regional scales.3 The list of acronyms used in the WGI Report is in Annex VIII.\n",
      "Text at the beginning of a section presented in dark blue with a blue vertical bar at the left, as shown here, provides a summary of the findings discussed in that section.\n",
      "The AR6 WGI Report promotes best practices in traceability and reproducibility, including through adoption of the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles for scientific data.\n",
      "Each chapter has a data table (in its Supplementary Material) documenting the input data and code used to generate its figures and tables.\n",
      "In addition, a collection of data and code from the report has been made freely-available online via long-term archives.4 These FAIR principles are central to the WGI Interactive Atlas5, an online tool that complements the WGI Report by providing flexible spatial and temporal analyses of past, observed and projected climate change information.\n",
      "It comprises a regional information component that supports many of the chapters of the Report and a regional synthesis component that supports the Technical Summary and Summary for Policymakers.\n",
      "Regarding the representation of robustness and uncertainty in maps, the method chosen for the AR66 differs from the method used in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).\n",
      "This choice is based on new research on the visualization of uncertainty and on user surveys.\n",

      "This concept is often expressed as the ratio of the change in a climate variable relative to the amplitude of natural variations of that variable (often termed a ‘signal-to-noise’ ratio, with emergence occurring at a defined threshold of this ratio).\n",

      "‘Climate drivers’, such as an increase in greenhouse gases or aerosols, interfere with this balance, causing the system to either gain or lose energy.\n",
      "The strength of a climate driver is quantified by its effective radiative forcing (ERF), measured in W m–2.\n",
      "Positive ERF leads to warming, and negative ERF leads to cooling.\n",

      "As a result, there are already substantial committed changes associated with past greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "For example, global mean sea level will continue to rise for thousands of years, even if future CO 2 emissions are reduced to net zero and global warming halted, as excess energy due to past emissions continues to propagate into the deep ocean and as glaciers and ice sheets continue to melt.\n",

      "(Sections TS.1.2, TS.2.1 and TS.3.1) • Observed global warming to date: A combination of improved observational records and a series of very warm years since AR5 have resulted in a substantial increase in the estimated level of global warming to date.\n",
      "The contribution of changes in observational understanding alone between AR5 and AR6 leads to an increase of about 0.1°C in the estimated warming since 1850–1900.\n",
      "For the decade 2011–2020, the increase in global surface temperature since 1850–1900 is assessed to be 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C.11 Estimates of crossing times of global warming levels and estimates of remaining carbon budgets are updated accordingly.\n",
      "(Section TS.1.2, Cross-Section Box TS.1) • Paleoclimate evidence: The AR5 assessed that many of the changes observed since the 1950s are unprecedented over decades to millennia.\n",
      "Updated paleoclimate evidence strengthens this assessment; over the past several decades, key indicators of the climate system are increasingly at levels unseen in centuries to millennia and are changing at rates unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years.\n",

      "Based on updated observational datasets showing a larger trend over 1998–2012 than earlier estimates, there is now high confidence that the observed 1998–2012 global surface temperature trend is consistent with ensembles of climate model simulations, and there is now very high confidence that the slower rate of global surface temperature increase observed over this period was a temporary event induced by internal and naturally forced variability that partly offset the anthropogenic surface warming trend over this period, while heat uptake continued to increase in the ocean.\n",
      "Since 2012, strong warming has been observed, with the past five years (2016–2020) being the hottest five- year period in the instrumental record since at least 1850 (high confidence).\n",
      "(Section TS.1.2, Cross-Section Box TS.1) • Magnitude of climate system response: In this Report, it has been possible to reduce the long-standing uncertainty ranges for metrics that quantify the response of the climate system to radiative forcing, such as the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and the transient climate response (TCR), due to substantial advances (e.g., a 50% reduction in the uncertainty range of cloud feedbacks) and improved integration of multiple lines of evidence, including paleoclimate information.\n",
      "Improved quantification of ERF, the climate system radiative response, and the observed energy increase in the Earth system over the past five decades demonstrate improved consistency between independent estimates of climate drivers, the combined climate feedbacks, and the observed energy increase relative to AR5.\n",

      "The magnitude of uncertainty in the ERF due to black carbon emissions has also been reduced relative to AR5.\n",
      "(Section TS.3.1) • Global water cycle: The AR5 assessed that anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960.\n",
      "The dedicated chapter in AR6 (Chapter 8) concludes with high confidence that human-caused climate change has driven detectable changes in the global water cycle since the mid-20th century, with a better understanding of the response to aerosol and greenhouse gas changes.\n",
      "The AR6 further projects with high confidence an increase in the variability of the water cycle in most regions of the world and under all emissions scenarios.\n",
      "(Box TS.6) • Extreme events: The AR5 assessed that human influence had been detected in changes in some climate extremes.\n",
      "A dedicated chapter in AR6 (Chapter 11) concludes that it is now an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased frequency and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since 1850, in particular for temperature extremes.\n",
      "Evidence of observed changes and attribution to human influence has strengthened for several types of extremes since AR5, in particular for extreme precipitation, droughts, tropical cyclones and compound extremes (including fire weather).\n",
      "(Sections TS.1.2 and TS.2.1, Box TS.10) Selected Updates and/or New Results Since AR5 and SR1.5 • Timing of crossing 1.5°C global warming: Slightly different approaches are used in SR1.5 and in this Report.\n",
      "SR1.5 assessed a likely range of 2030 to 2052 for reaching a global warming level of 1.5°C (for a 30-year period), assuming a continued, constant rate of warming.\n",
      "In AR6, combining the larger estimate of global warming to date and the assessed climate response to all considered scenarios, the central estimate of crossing 1.5°C of global warming (for a 20-year period) occurs in the early 2030s, in the early part of the likely range assessed in SR1.5, assuming no major volcanic eruption.\n",
      "(Section TS.1.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1) • Remaining carbon budgets: The AR5 had assessed the transient climate response to cumulative emissions of CO 2 to be likely in the range of 0.8°C to 2.5°C per 1000 GtC (1 Gigatonne of carbon, GtC, = 1 Petagram of carbon, PgC, = 3.664 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, GtCO 2), and this was also used in SR1.5.\n",
      "The assessment in AR6, based on multiple lines of evidence, leads to a narrower likely range of 1.0°C–2.3°C per 1000 GtC.\n",
      "This has been incorporated in updated estimates of remaining carbon budgets (see Section TS.3.3.1), together with methodological improvements and recent observations.\n",

      "Stratification is an important indicator for ocean circulation.• Effect of short-lived climate forcers on global warming in coming decades: The SR1.5 stated that reductions in emissions of cooling aerosols partially offset greenhouse gas mitigation effects for two to three decades in pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C.\n",
      "The AR6 assessment updates the AR5 assessment of the net cooling effect of aerosols and confirms that changes in short-lived climate forcers will very likely cause further warming in the next two decades across all scenarios.\n",
      "(Section TS.1.3, Box TS.7) • COVID-19: Temporary emissions reductions in 2020 associated with COVID-19 containment led to small and positive net radiative effect (warming influence).\n",
      "However, global and regional climate responses to this forcing are undetectable above internal climate variability due to the temporary nature of emissions reductions.\n",
      "(Section TS.3.3) Selected Updates and/or New Results Since AR5, SRCCL and SROCC • Atmospheric concentration of methane: The SRCCL reported a resumption of atmospheric CH 4 concentration growth since 2007.\n",
      "The AR6 reports a faster growth over 2014–2019 and assesses growth since 2007 to be largely driven by emissions from the fossil fuels and agriculture (dominated by livestock) sectors.\n",
      "(Section TS.2.2) • Land and ocean carbon sinks: The SRCCL assessed that the persistence of the land carbon sink is uncertain due to climate change.\n",
      "The AR6 finds that land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to continue to grow until 2100 with increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO 2, but the fraction of emissions taken up by land and ocean is expected to decline as the CO 2 concentration increases, with a much larger uncertainty range for the land sink.\n",
      "The AR5, SR1.5 and SRCCL assessed carbon dioxide removal options and scenarios.\n",
      "The AR6 finds that the carbon cycle response is asymmetric for pulse emissions or removals, which means that CO 2 emissions would be more effective at raising atmospheric CO 2 than CO 2 removals are at lowering atmospheric CO 2.\n",
      "(Section TS.3.3, Box TS.5) • Ocean stratification increase12 : Refined analyses of available observations in the AR6 lead to a reassessment of the rate of increase of the global stratification in the upper 200 m to be double that estimated in SROCC from 1970 to 2018.\n",
      "(Section TS.2.4) • Projected ocean oxygen loss: Future subsurface oxygen decline in new projections assessed in WGI AR6 is substantially greater in 2080–2099 than assessed in SROCC.\n",
      "(Section TS.2.4) • Ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets: Since SROCC, globally resolved glacier changes have improved estimates of glacier mass loss over the past 20 years, and estimates of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet loss have been extended to 2020.\n",
      "(Section TS.2.5) • Observed global mean sea level change: new observation- based estimates published since SROCC lead to an assessed sea level rise estimate from 1901 to 2018 that is now consistent with the sum of individual components and consistent with closure of the global energy budget.\n",
      "(Box TS.4)\n",
      "43 Technical SummaryTS• Projected global mean sea level change: The AR6 projections of global mean sea level are based on projections from ocean thermal expansion and land ice contribution estimates, which are consistent with the assessed ECS and assessed changes in global surface temperature.\n",

      "viiForeword Foreword ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, the Working Group II contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report presents a comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge of the observed impacts and projected risks of climate change as well as the adaptation options.\n",
      "The report confirms the strong interactions of the natural, social and climate systems and that human-induced climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts to nature and people.\n",
      "It is clear that across sectors and regions, the most vulnerable people and systems are disproportionately affected and climate extremes have led to irreversible impacts.\n",
      "The assessment underscores the importance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C if we are to achieve a fair, equitable and sustainable world.\n",
      "While the assessment concluded that there are feasible and effective adaptation options which can reduce risks to nature and people, it also found that there are limits to adaptation and that there is a need for increased ambition in both adaptation and mitigation.\n",
      "These and other findings confirm and enhance our understanding of the importance of climate resilient development across sectors and regions and, as such, demands the urgent attention of both policymakers and the general public.\n",
      "As an intergovernmental body jointly established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the IPCC has provided policymakers with the most authoritative and objective scientific and technical assessments.\n",
      "Beginning in 1990, this series of IPCC Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, Methodology Reports and other products have become standard works of reference.\n",
      "This Working Group II contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report contains important new scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge that can be used to produce information and services for assisting society to act to address the challenges of climate change.\n",
      "The timing is particularly significant, as this information provides a new impetus, through clear assessment findings, to inform the first Global Stocktake under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n",
      "This Working Group II assessment was made possible thanks to the commitment and dedication of many hundreds of experts worldwide, representing a wide range of disciplines.\n",
      "WMO and UNEP are proud that so many of the experts belong to their communities and networks.\n",
      "We express our deep gratitude to all authors, review editors and expert reviewers for devoting their knowledge, expertise and time especially given the challenges created by the Covid pandemic.\n",
      "We would like to thank the staff of the Working Group II Technical Support Unit, the WGII Science Advisor and the IPCC Secretariat for their dedication.\n",
      "We are also grateful to the governments that supported their scientists' participation in developing this report and that contributed to the IPCC Trust Fund to provide for the essential participation of experts from developing countries and countries with economies in transition.\n",
      "We would like to express our appreciation to the government of Ethiopia for hosting the scoping meeting for the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report, to the governments of South Africa, Nepal, Portugal and Guatemala for hosting drafting meetings of the Working Group II contribution and to the government of Germany for hosting the Twelfth Session of Working Group II held virtually for approval of the Working Group II Report.\n",
      "The generous financial support by the government of Germany and the logistical support by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (Germany), enabled the smooth operation of the Working Group II Technical Support Unit in Bremen, Germany.\n",
      "Additional funding from the Governments of Germany, Norway and New Zealand provided key support to the Technical Support Unit office in Durban, South Africa.\n",
      "We would particularly like to thank Dr Hoesung Lee, Chairman of the IPCC, for his direction of the IPCC and we express our deep gratitude to Dr Hans-Otto Pörtner and Dr Debra Roberts, the Co-Chairs of Working Group II for their tireless leadership throughout the development and production of this report.\n",
      "Climate change is a long-term challenge, but the need for urgent action now is clear.\n",
      "The conclusion of the report’s Summary for Policymakers summarizes this succinctly.\n",
      "‘The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well- being and planetary health.\n",
      "Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.’ We couldn’t agree more.\n",

      "ixPreface Preface The Working Group II contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a comprehensive assessment of the scientific, technical and socio- economic literature relevant to impacts, adaptation and vulnerability.\n",
      "It builds upon the Working Group II contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, the three Special Reports of the Sixth Assessment cycle: ‘Global Warming of 1.5°C.\n",
      "An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5)’; ‘Climate Change and Land: An IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL)’; ‘IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)’, and the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.\n",
      "The report recognizes the interactions of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies, and integrates knowledge more strongly across the natural, ecological, social and economic sciences than earlier IPCC assessments.\n",
      "The assessment of climate change impacts and risks as well as adaptation is set against concurrently unfolding non-climatic global trends e.g., biodiversity loss, overall unsustainable consumption of natural resources, land and ecosystem degradation, rapid urbanisation, human demographic shifts, social and economic inequalities and a pandemic.\n",
      "Working Group II introduces several new components in its latest report: These include the novel cross-chapter papers which provide focused assessments and updates from the special reports and include coverage of topics such as biodiversity hotspots, cities and settlements by the sea, deserts and desertification, mountains, tropical forests as well as the Mediterranean and polar regions.\n",
      "Another new component is an atlas that presents data and findings on observed climate change impacts and projected risks from global to regional scales, thus offering even more insights for decision makers.\n",
      "The Working Group II Report is based on the published scientific and technical literature accepted for publication by 1 September 2021.\n",
      "Scope of the Report During the process of scoping and approving the outline of its Sixth Assessment Report, the IPCC focussed on those aspects of the current knowledge of climate change that were judged to be most relevant to policymakers.\n",
      "In this report, Working Group II examines the impacts of climate change on nature and people around the globe.\n",
      "It explores future impacts at different levels of warming and the resulting risks, and offers options to strengthen nature’s and society’s resilience to ongoing climate change, to fight hunger, poverty, and inequality and keep Earth a place worth living on – for current as well as for future generations.Structure of the Report This report consists of a short Summary for Policymakers, a Technical Summary, eighteen Chapters, seven Cross-Chapter Papers, five Annexes including the Global to Regional Atlas, as well as online Supplementary Material.\n",
      "The introductory chapter (Chapter 1) provides the reader with the framing and context of the report and highlights key concepts used throughout the report.\n",
      "The sectoral chapters (Chapters 2–8) cover risks, adaptation and sustainability for systems impacted by climate change.\n",
      "They assess impacts, risks, adaptation options and limits and the interactions of risks and responses for climate resilient development for ecosystems, water, food, cities, human health, communities and livelihoods.\n",
      "The regional chapters (Chapters 9–15) assess the observed impacts and projected risks at regional and sub-regional levels for Africa, Asia, Australasia, Central and South America, Europe, North America and Small Islands.\n",
      "They assess adaptation options including limits, barriers and adaptive capacity, as well as the interaction of risks and responses for climate resilient development.\n",
      "The Cross-Chapter Papers (1–7) consider additional regionalisation’s including polar regions, tropical forests, deserts, mountains and the Mediterranean, as well as highlighting the topics of biodiversity hotspots and cities by the sea.\n",
      "The cross-chapter papers assess observed impacts and projected risks of climate change, vulnerability, adaptation options and, where applicable, climate resilient development.\n",
      "The synthesis chapters (Chapters 16–18) address sustainable devel- opment pathways integrating adaptation and mitigation.\n",
      "They assess key risks across sectors and regions (Chapter 16) and decision-making options for managing risk (Chapter 17) and the ways climate impacts and risks hinder climate resilient development in different sectoral and regional contexts as well as the pathways to achieving climate resilient development (Chapter 18).\n",
      "The Process This Working Group II contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report represents the combined efforts of hundreds of experts in the scientific, technological and socio-economic fields of climate science and has been prepared in accordance with rules and procedures established by the IPCC.\n",
      "A scoping meeting for the Sixth Assessment Report was held in May 2017 and the outlines for the contributions of the three Working Groups were approved at the 46th Session of the Panel in September 2017.\n",

      "5SPM Summary for PolicymakersA: Introduction This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents key findings of the Working Group II (WGII) contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC1.\n",
      "The report builds on the WGII contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC, three Special Reports2, and the Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the AR6 cycle.\n",
      "This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity3, and human societies (Figure SPM.1) and integrates knowledge more strongly across the natural, ecological, social and economic sciences than earlier IPCC assessments.\n",
      "The assessment of climate change impacts and risks as well as adaptation is set against concurrently unfolding non-climatic global trends e.g., biodiversity loss, overall unsustainable consumption of natural resources, land and ecosystem degradation, rapid urbanisation, human demographic shifts, social and economic inequalities and a pandemic.\n",
      "The scientific evidence for each key finding is found in the 18 chapters of the underlying report and in the 7 cross-chapter papers as well as the integrated synthesis presented in the Technical Summary (hereafter TS) and referred to in curly brackets {}.\n",
      "Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of confidence using the IPCC calibrated language4.\n",
      "The WGII Global to Regional Atlas (Annex I) facilitates exploration of key synthesis findings across the WGII regions.\n",
      "The concept of risk is central to all three AR6 Working Groups.\n",
      "A risk framing and the concepts of adaptation, vulnerability, exposure, resilience, equity and justice, and transformation provide alternative, overlapping, complementary, and widely used entry points to the literature assessed in this WGII report.\n",
      "Across all three AR6 working groups, risk5 provides a framework for understanding the increasingly severe, interconnected and often irreversible impacts of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and human systems; differing impacts across regions, sectors and communities; and how to best reduce adverse consequences for current and future generations.\n",
      "In the context of climate change, risk can arise from the dynamic interactions among climate-related hazards6 (see Working Group I), the exposure7 and vulnerability8 of affected human and ecological systems.\n",
      "The risk that can be introduced by human responses to climate change is a new aspect considered in the risk concept.\n",
      "This report identifies 127 key risks9.\n",
      "{1.3, 16.5} The vulnerability of exposed human and natural systems is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus in the literature.\n",
      "Approaches to analysing and assessing vulnerability have evolved since previous IPCC assessments.\n",
      "Vulnerability is widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, regions and countries, also changing through time.\n",
      "Adaptation10 plays a key role in reducing exposure and vulnerability to climate change.\n",
      "Adaptation in ecological systems includes autonomous adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes.\n",
      "In human systems, adaptation can be anticipatory or reactive, as well as incremental 1 Decision IPCC/XLVI-3, The assessment covers scientific literature accepted for publication by 1 September 2021.\n",
      "2 The three Special Reports are: ‘Global Warming of 1.5°C.\n",
      "An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5)’; ‘Climate Change and Land.\n",
      "An IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL)’; ‘IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)’.\n",
      "3 Biodiversity: Biodiversity or biological diversity means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, among other things, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems.\n",
      "4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement.\n",
      "A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence.\n",
      "The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%.\n",
      "Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely.\n",
      "This is consistent with AR5 and the other AR6 Reports.\n",
      "5 Risk is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems.\n",
      "6 Hazard is defined as the potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources.\n",
      "Physical climate conditions that may be associated with hazards are assessed in Working Group I as climatic impact-drivers.\n",
      "7 Exposure is defined as the presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected.\n",
      "8 Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.\n",
      "9 Key risks have potentially severe adverse consequences for humans and social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of climate related hazards with vulnerabilities of societies and systems exposed.\n",
      "10 Adaptation is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to moderate harm or take advantage of beneficial opportunities.\n",
      "In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate this.\n",

      "Adaptation is subject to hard and soft limits11.\n",
      "Resilience12 in the literature has a wide range of meanings.\n",
      "Adaptation is often organized around resilience as bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance.\n",
      "More broadly the term describes not just the ability to maintain essential function, identity and structure, but also the capacity for transformation.\n",
      "This report recognises the value of diverse forms of knowledge such as scientific, as well as Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge in understanding and evaluating climate adaptation processes and actions to reduce risks from human-induced climate change.\n",
      "AR6 highlights adaptation solutions which are effective, feasible13, and conform to principles of justice14.\n",
      "The term climate justice, while used in different ways in different contexts by different communities, generally includes three principles: distributive justice which refers to the allocation of burdens and benefits among individuals, nations and generations; procedural justice which refers to who decides and participates in decision-making; and recognition which entails basic respect and robust engagement with and fair consideration of diverse cultures and perspectives.\n",
      "Effectiveness refers to the extent to which an action reduces vulnerability and climate-related risk, increases resilience, and avoids maladaptation15.\n",
      "This report has a particular focus on transformation16 and system transitions in energy; land, ocean, coastal and freshwater ecosystems; urban, rural and infrastructure; and industry and society.\n",
      "These transitions make possible the adaptation required for high levels of human health and well-being, economic and social resilience, ecosystem health17, and planetary health18 (Figure SPM.1).\n",
      "These system transitions are also important for achieving the low global warming levels (Working Group III) that would avoid many limits to adaptation11.\n",
      "The report also assesses economic and non-economic losses and damages19.\n",
      "This report labels the process of implementing mitigation and adaptation together in support of sustainable development for all as climate resilient development20.\n",

      "Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from illustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)21 and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)22 scenarios, respectively23.\n",
      "Climate impacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though some recent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise.\n",

      "Soft adaptation limit—Options may exist but are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action.\n",
      "12 Resilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and ecosystems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure as well as biodiversity in case of ecosystems while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.\n",
      "Resilience is a positive attribute when it maintains such a capacity for adaptation, learning, and/or transformation.\n",
      "13 Feasibility refers to the potential for an adaptation option to be implemented.\n",
      "14 Justice is concerned with setting out the moral or legal principles of fairness and equity in the way people are treated, often based on the ethics and values of society.\n",
      "Social justice comprises just or fair relations within society that seek to address the distribution of wealth, access to resources, opportunity and support according to principles of justice and fairness.\n",
      "Climate justice comprises justice that links development and human rights to achieve a rights-based approach to addressing climate change.\n",
      "15 Maladaptation refers to actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future.\n",
      "Most often, maladaptation is an unintended consequence.\n",
      "16 Transformation refers to a change in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems.\n",
      "17 Ecosystem health: a metaphor used to describe the condition of an ecosystem, by analogy with human health.\n",
      "Note that there is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem.\n",
      "Rather, the apparent health status of an ecosystem is judged on the ecosystem’s resilience to change, with details depending upon which metrics (such as species richness and abundance) are employed in judging it and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment.\n",
      "18 Planetary health: a concept based on the understanding that human health and human civilisation depend on ecosystem health and the wise stewardship of ecosystems.\n",
      "19 In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic.\n",
      "20 In the WGII report, climate resilient development refers to the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation measures to support sustainable development for all.\n",

      "40 Technical Summary TSTS.A Introduction TS.A.1 Background This technical summary complements and expands the key findings of the Working Group (WG) II contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) presented in the Summary for Policymakers and covers literature accepted for publication by 1 September 2021.\n",
      "It provides technical understanding and is developed from the key findings of chapters and cross-chapter papers (CCPs) as presented in their executive summaries and integrates across them.\n",
      "The report builds on the WGII contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC and three special reports of the AR6 cycle providing new knowledge and updates.\n",
      "The three special reports are the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018), an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty; the Special Report on Climate Change and Land, which is concerned with climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (2019); and the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019).\n",
      "The WGII assessment integrates with the WGI (the physical science basis) and WGIII (mitigation of climate change) contributions and contributes to the Synthesis Report.\n",
      "The contribution of Working Group II (WGII) to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC summarizes the current understanding of observed climate change impacts on ecosystems, human societies and their cities, settlements, infrastructures and industrial systems, as well as vulnerabilities and future risks tied to different socioeconomic development pathways.\n",
      "The report is set against a current backdrop of rapid urbanisation, biodiversity loss, a growing and dynamic global human population, significant inequality and demands for social justice, rapid technological change, continuing poverty, land degradation and food insecurity, and risks from shocks such as pandemics and increasingly intense extreme events from ongoing climate change.\n",
      "The report also assesses existing adaptations and their feasibility and limits.\n",
      "Any success of adaptation is dependent on the achieved level of mitigation and the transformation of global and regional sustainability outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n",
      "Accordingly, adaptation is essential for climate resilient development.\n",
      "Compared to earlier IPCC assessments, this report integrates more strongly across the natural, social and economic sciences, highlighting the role of social justice and diverse forms of knowledge, such as Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, and reflects the increasing importance of urgent and immediate action to address climate risk.\n",
      "{1.1.1} Since AR5, climate action has increased at all levels of governance, including among non-governmental organisations, small and large enterprises, and citizens.\n",
      "Two international agreements—the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development— jointly provide overarching goals for climate action.\n",
      "The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015 by UN member states, sets out 17 SDGs, frames policies for achieving a more sustainable future and aligns efforts globally to prioritise ending extreme poverty, protect the planet and promote more peaceful, prosperous and inclusive societies.\n",
      "Since AR5, several new international conventions have identified climate change adaptation and risk reduction as important global priorities for sustainable development, including the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), the finance- oriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the New Urban Agenda.\n",
      "The Convention on Biological Diversity and its Aichi targets recognise that biodiversity is affected by climate change, with negative consequences for human well-being, but biodiversity, through ecosystem services, contributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n",
      "{1.1.2} TS.A.2 TS Structure of the Report This technical summary is structured in five sections: Section A ‘Introduction’, Section B ‘Observed Impacts and Adaptation’, Section C ‘Projected Impacts and Risks’, Section D ‘Contribution of Adaptation to Solutions’ and Section E ‘Climate Resilient Development’.\n",
      "Each section includes several headline statements followed by several bullet points providing details about the underlying assessments.\n",
      "All findings and figures are supported by and traceable to the underlying report, indicated by references {in curly brackets} to relevant sections of chapters and cross-chapter papers.\n",
      "Confidence in the key findings of this assessment is communicated using the IPCC calibrated uncertainty language.\n",
      "This calibrated language is designed to consistently evaluate and communicate uncertainties that arise from incomplete knowledge due to a lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable.\n",
      "The IPCC calibrated language uses qualitative expressions of confidence based on the robustness of evidence for a finding and (where possible) uses quantitative expressions to describe the likelihood of a finding.\n",
      "Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement.\n",
      "A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers, very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence.\n",
      "The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%.\n",
      "Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, very likely.\n",
      "This is consistent with AR5 and the other AR6 reports.\n",
      "(Figure TS.1) {1.3.4} TS.A.3 Key Developments Since AR5 Interdisciplinary climate change assessment, which has played a prominent role in science–society interactions on the climate issue since 1988, has advanced in important ways since AR5.\n",
      "Building on a substantially expanded scientific and technical literature, this AR6 report emphasises at least three broad themes.\n",
      "(Figure TS.2) {1.1.4} First, this AR6 assessment has an increased focus on risk and solution frameworks.\n",
      "The risk framing can move beyond the limits of single best estimates or most likely outcomes and include high-consequence outcomes for which probabilities are low or in some cases unknown.\n",
      "41 Technical SummaryTS In this report, the risk framing for the first time spans all three working groups, includes risks from the responses to climate change, considers dynamic and cascading consequences, describes with more geographic detail risks to people and ecosystems, and assesses such risks over a range of scenarios.\n",
      "The focus on solutions encompasses the interconnections among climate responses, sustainable development and transformation—and the implications for governance across scales within the public and private sectors.\n",
      "The assessment therefore includes climate-related decision-making and risk management, climate resilient development pathways, implementation and evaluation of adaptation, and also limits to adaptation and loss and damage.\n",
      "Specific focal areas reflect contexts increasingly important for the implementation of responses, such as cities.\n",
      "{1.3.1, 1.4.4, 16, 17, 18} Second, emphases on social justice, equity and different forms of expertise have emerged.\n",
      "As climate change impacts and implemented responses increasingly occur, there is heightened awareness of the ways that climate responses interact with issues of justice and social progress.\n",
      "In this report, expanded attention is given to inequity in climate vulnerability and responses, the role of power and participation in processes of implementation, unequal and differential impacts and climate justice.\n",
      "The historic focus on scientific literature has also been increasingly accompanied by attention to and incorporation of Indigenous knowledge, local knowledge, and associated scholars.\n",
      "{1.3.2, 1.4.1, 17.5.2} Third, AR6 has a more extensive focus on the role of transformation in meeting societal goals.\n",
      "{1.5} The following overarching conclusions have been derived from the whole of the assessment of WGII: i) The magnitude of observed impacts and projected climate risks indicate the scale of decision-making, funding and investment needed over the next decade if climate resilient development is to be achieved.\n",

      "Feasible, integrated mitigation and adaptation solutions can be tailored to specific locations and monitored for their effectiveness while avoiding conflict with sustainable development objectives and managing risks and trade- offs (high confidence).iii) Available evidence on projected climate risks indicates that opportunities for adaptation to many climate risks will likely become constrained and have reduced effectiveness should 1.5°C global warming be exceeded and that, for many locations on Earth, capacity for adaptation is already significantly limited.\n",
      "The maintenance and recovery of natural and human systems will require the achievement of mitigation targets.\n",
      "Box TS.1 | Core Concepts of the Report This box provides an overview of key definitions and concepts relevant to the WGII AR6 assessment, with a focus on those updated or new since AR5.\n",
      "Risk in this report is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems.\n",
      "In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system.\n",
      "In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not to achieve the intended objective(s) or from potential trade-offs or negative side-effects.\n",
      "Risk management is defined as plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks.\n",
      "{1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary} Vulnerability is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus.\n",
      "Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (Annex II: Glossary).\n",
      "Over the past several decades, approaches to analysing and assessing vulnerability have evolved.\n",
      "An early emphasis on top-down, biophysical evaluation of vulnerability included—and often started with—exposure to climate hazards in assessing vulnerability.\n",
      "From this starting point, attention to bottom-up, social and contextual determinants of vulnerability, which often differ, has emerged, although this approach is incompletely applied or integrated across contexts.\n",
      "Vulnerability is now widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, also changing through time.\n",
      "In WGII AR6, assessment of the vulnerability of people and ecosystems encompasses the differing approaches that exist within the literature, both critiquing and harmonising them based on available evidence.\n",
      "In this context, exposure is defined as the presence of people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected.\n",
      "Potentially affected places and settings can be defined geographically, as well as more dynamically, for example through transmission or interconnections through markets or flows of people.\n",
      "{1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary} Adaptation in this report is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.\n",
      "In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate this (see Annex II: Glossary).\n",
      "Adaptation planning in human systems generally entails a process of iterative risk management.\n",
      "Different types of adaptation have been distinguished, including anticipatory versus reactive, autonomous versus planned and incremental versus transformational adaptation.\n",
      "Adaptation is often seen as having five general stages: (a) awareness, (b) assessment, (c) planning, (d) implementation and (e) monitoring and evaluation.\n",
      "Government, non-government, and private-sector actors have adopted a wide variety of specific approaches to adaptation that, to varying degrees, conform to these five general stages.\n",
      "Adaptation in natural systems includes autonomous adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes.\n",
      "It also involves the use of nature through ecosystem-based adaptation.\n",
      "The role of species, biodiversity and ecosystems in such adaptation options can range from the rehabilitation or restoration of ecosystems (e.g., wetlands or mangroves) to hybrid combinations of so- called green and grey infrastructure (e.g., horizontal levees).\n",
      "The WGII AR6 emphasises the assessment of observed adaptation-related responses to climate change, governance and decision-making in adaptation and the role of adaptation in reducing key risks and global- scale reasons for concern, as well as limits to such adaptation.\n",
      "{1.2.1, 17.4} Resilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.\n",
      "Resilience is an entry point commonly used, although under a wide spectrum of meanings.\n",
      "Resilience as a system trait overlaps with concepts of vulnerability, adaptive capacity and, thus, risk, and resilience as a strategy overlaps with risk management, adaptation and transformation.\n",
      "Implemented adaptation is often organised around resilience as bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance.\n",
      "{1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}\n",
      "44 Technical Summary TSBox TS.2 | AR6 Climate Dimensions, Global Warming Levels and Reference Periods Assessments of climate risks consider possible future climate change, societal development and responses.\n",
      "This report assesses literature including that based on climate model simulations that are part of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase (CMIP5, CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme.\n",
      "Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from illustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)1 and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)2 scenarios, respectively3.\n",
      "Climate impacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though some recent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise.\n",
      "Given differences in the impacts literature regarding socioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as appropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development.\n",
      "There are many emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome.\n",
      "These represent a broad range of possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability.\n",
      "Where available, WGII also assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs2.\n",
      "The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including impacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding.\n",
      "{1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 SPM.C, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6 12, WGI AR5} A common set of reference years and time periods are adopted for assessing climate change and its impacts and risks: the reference period 1850–1900 approximates pre-industrial global surface temperature, and three future reference periods cover the near-term (2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100).\n",
      "{CCB CLIMATE} Common levels of global warming relative to 1850–1900 are used to contextualize and facilitate analysis, synthesis and communication of assessed past, present and future climate change impacts and risks considering multiple lines of evidence.\n",
      "Robust geographical patterns of many variables can be identified at a given level of global warming, common to all scenarios considered and independent of timing when the global warming level is reached.\n",
      "{16.5, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 Box SPM.1, WGI AR6 4.2, WGI AR6 CCB11.1} WGI assessed increase in global surface temperature is 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]4 °C in 2011–2020 above 1850–1900.\n",
      "The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C).5 Considering all five illustrative scenarios assessed by WGI, there is at least a greater than 50% likelihood that global warming will reach or exceed 1.5°C in the near-term, even for the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario6.\n",
      "{WGI AR6 SPM A1.2, WGI AR6 SPM B1.3, WGI AR6 Table SPM.1, WGI AR6 CCB2.3} 1 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\n",
      "2 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway describing the socio-economic trends underlying the scenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\n",
      "3 IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the SSPs, which do not cover all possible scenarios.\n",
      "Alternative scenarios may be considered or developed.\n",
      "4 In the WGI report, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.\n",
      "5 Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic.\n",

      "v ForewordForeword Foreword Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change is the third part of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and was prepared by its Working Group III.\n",
      "The volume provides an updated global assessment of current and projected emissions from all sources and sectors, mitigation options that reduce emissions or remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and progress towards meeting climate ambitions.\n",
      "It assesses what is required to achieve net zero emissions as pledged by many countries.\n",
      "This report shows that greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade are at the highest levels in human history.\n",
      "It shows that urgent action is needed.\n",
      "Unless there are immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5°C will be beyond reach.\n",
      "Global greenhouse gas emissions implied by Nationally Determined Contributions announced prior to COP26 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C and will also make it harder to limit warming to below 2°C.\n",
      "But there are positive signs and increased evidence of climate action.\n",
      "Options are available now in every sector that can at least halve emissions by 2030.\n",
      "Some countries have already achieved a steady decrease in emissions consistent with limiting warming to 2°C.\n",
      "Costs for some forms of renewable energy have fallen, use of renewables continues to rise and, in some countries and regions, electricity systems are already predominantly powered by renewables.\n",
      "This IPCC report highlights for the first time the social and demand-side aspects of climate mitigation.\n",
      "As long as the necessary policies, infrastructure and technologies are in place, changes to lifestyles and behaviour have the potential for large reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions and, at the same time, lead to improved wellbeing.\n",
      "The report calls attention to the deep links between climate mitigation and sustainable development.\n",
      "It draws attention to the way that climate action is intimately connected to addressing the nature crisis.\n",
      "Attention to equity and just transitions can support deeper ambition for accelerated climate action.\n",
      "The findings in this report have considerably enhanced our understanding of available mitigation pathways.\n",
      "The timing of this report is critical.\n",
      "It provides crucial information that informs the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement.\n",
      "It demands the urgent attention of policymakers and the general public.As an intergovernmental body jointly established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the IPCC has successfully provided policymakers with the most authoritative and objective scientific and technical assessments, which are policy relevant without being policy prescriptive.\n",
      "Beginning in 1990, this series of IPCC Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, Methodology Reports and other products have become standard works of reference.\n",
      "This Working Group III assessment was made possible thanks to the commitment and dedication of many hundreds of experts, representing a wide range of regions and scientific disciplines.\n",
      "WMO and UNEP are proud that so many of the experts belong to their communities and networks.\n",
      "We express our deep gratitude to all authors, review editors and expert reviewers for devoting their knowledge, expertise and time.\n",
      "We note the particular challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and the burdens placed on experts.\n",
      "We would like to thank the staff of the Working Group III Technical Support Unit and the IPCC Secretariat for their dedication.\n",
      "We are also thankful to the governments that supported their scientists’ participation in developing this report and that contributed to the IPCC Trust Fund to provide for the essential participation of experts from developing countries and countries with economies in transition.\n",
      "We would like to express our appreciation to the government of Ethiopia for hosting the scoping meeting for the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report, to the governments of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, India, Ecuador and Italy for hosting drafting sessions for the Working Group III contribution.\n",
      "The latter two meetings were held in a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "We also express our thanks to the government of the United Kingdom for hosting the Fourteenth Session of Working Group III for approval of the Working Group III Report.\n",
      "The generous financial support by the government of the United Kingdom, and the hosting of the Working Group III Technical Support Unit by Imperial College London (United Kingdom) and Ahmedabad University (India), is gratefully acknowledged.\n",

      "vi PrefacePreface Preface The Working Group III (WG III) contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a comprehensive and transparent assessment of the scientific literature on climate change mitigation.\n",
      "It builds upon the WG III contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014, the WG I and WG II contributions to the AR6, and the three AR6 Special Reports: Global Warming of 1.5°C; Climate Change and Land; and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.\n",
      "The report assesses progress in climate change mitigation and options for reducing emissions and enhancing sinks.\n",
      "It evaluates the societal implications of mitigation actions, without recommending any specific options.\n",
      "Scope of the Report The scoping of the WG III contribution to AR6 was driven by three guiding principles: to achieve a better synthesis between higher-level whole system and grounded bottom-up insights into technologies and other approaches for reducing emissions; to make wider use of social science disciplines, especially for gaining insight into issues related to lifestyle, behaviour, consumption and socio-technical transitions; and to link climate change mitigation better to other agreed policy goals both nationally and internationally.\n",
      "The core of the report remains, as in AR5, a set of chapters devoted to different sectors, broadly aligned with the categorisation used in the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n",
      "These chapters cover emission trends and drivers, mitigation costs and potentials, regional specificities, and sector specific barriers, policies, financing and enabling conditions.\n",
      "A systems level perspective was followed where appropriate.\n",
      "A cross-sectoral perspectives chapter integrates findings from the sectoral chapters and assesses approaches falling outside the scope of individual sectors.\n",
      "As in the AR5, there is a chapter on recent trends and drivers, with the scope expanded to cover historic emissions and recent policy developments.\n",
      "Following the pattern established in the WG III AR5 report, and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, this report assesses published emission scenarios with a 21st century perspective.\n",
      "Modelled emission scenarios are categorised according to climate outcomes, allowing a handshake with the WG I assessment.\n",
      "To meet the goal of linking top-down and bottom-up insights, the report includes an additional pathways chapter that provides a mid- century perspective, focussing on national and regional scales and the alignment between development pathways and mitigation actions.\n",
      "As in the AR5, this report addresses mitigation enablers such as international cooperation, finance and investment, and policies and institutions, with a greater emphasis placed on the role of institutions than in the AR5.\n",
      "A new chapter is dedicated to the assessment of innovation systems, technology development and technology transfer.\n",
      "A further novelty is a chapter that assesses the literature on human behaviour, lifestyle and culture, and its implications for mitigation action.\n",
      "This chapter touches on patterns of development and human well-being, and circular and sharing economy concepts.\n",
      "It brings a wide range of disciplines, notably from the social sciences, within the scope of the WG III assessment.\n",
      "Linkages with development and specifically the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) permeate the WG III report.\n",
      "This framing is set up in Chapter 1, and the threads are drawn together in the final chapter where linkages between mitigation and the SDGs are systematically assessed.\n",
      "The AR6 has benefited from close and unprecedented collaboration between the three IPCC WGs: with WG I on scenarios and with WG II on urban systems, land use and development pathways.\n",
      "This collaboration is manifested in a number of Cross-Working Group boxes covering topics such as the economic benefits from avoided impacts along mitigation pathways, climate change and urban areas, mitigation and adaptation through the bioeconomy, and solar radiation modification.\n",
      "Structure of the Report This report consists of a Summary for Policymakers, a Technical Summary, 17 Chapters, six Annexes, and Index, as well as online Supplementary Material to chapters.\n",
      "Chapters 1 (Introduction and framing) and 17 (Accelerating the transition in the context of sustainable development), the first and final chapters of the report, set climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable development.\n",
      "Chapter 1 sets out the evolving policy landscape for climate mitigation, provides the reader with the framing of, and context for, the report, and highlights key concepts.\n",
      "Chapter 17 adopts an integrative perspective on sustainable development and climate change responses, identifying synergies and trade-offs, and explores joint responses to climate change and sustainable development challenges.\n",
      "Chapters 2–4 take a high-level view of trends and future pathways using three different time frames.\n",
      "Chapter 2 (Emissions trends and drivers) covers historic and current emission trends and socio- economic and demographic drivers of emissions.\n",
      "It also maps developments in technologies and policies since the AR5.\n",
      "Chapter 3 (Mitigation pathways compatible with long-term goals) assesses modelled emission pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement and higher warming levels.\n",
      "It addresses socio-cultural-techno- economic assumptions, technological and behavioural aspects of mitigation pathways, and links to adaptation and sustainable development.\n",
      "Chapter 4 (Mitigation and development pathways in the near- to mid-term) takes a mid-century perspective, considering national, regional and international scales and the implications\n",
      "vii PrefacePrefaceof mitigation for national development objectives including employment, competitiveness, poverty eradication and the SDGs.\n",
      "Annex III (Scenarios and modelling methods) provides methodological background to Chapters 3 and 4.\n",
      "Chapter 5 (Demand, services and social aspects of mitigation), a new chapter in AR6, explores how mitigation interacts with meeting human needs and access to services.\n",
      "It explores, inter alia: sustainable production and consumption; patterns of development and indicators of wellbeing; the role of culture, social norms, practices and behaviour changes; the sharing economy and circular economy; and policies facilitating behavioural and lifestyle change.\n",
      "Chapters 6–12 (Energy systems; Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses (AFOLU); Urban systems and other settlements; Buildings; Transport; Industry; Cross-sectoral perspectives) assess the potential for emissions reductions in specific systems and sectors, taking into account trends in emissions and their key drivers, global and regional costs and potentials, links to climate adaptation and associated risks and co-benefits, and sector specific barriers, policies, financing and enabling conditions.\n",
      "Specificities include fugitive emissions and carbon capture and storage (Energy), provision of food, feed, fibre, wood, biomass for energy and other ecosystem services (AFOLU), demographic changes and urban form (Urban systems and other settlements), mitigation strategies including efficiency, sufficiency and renewables (Buildings), access to mobility (Transport), and resource efficiency (Industry).\n",
      "Chapter 12 (Cross-sectoral perspectives) synthesises costs and potentials, and co-benefits and trade-offs, across sectors; it also addresses cross-cutting approaches such as carbon dioxide removal and mitigation opportunities in the food system.\n",
      "Chapters 13–16 address enabling conditions for mitigation action.\n",
      "Chapter 13 (National and sub-national policies and institutions) provides insights from national and subnational plans and strategies, including trends in legislation and institutions.\n",
      "Chapter 14 (International cooperation) assesses international cooperation and institutions, including linkages with non-climate organisations and processes, international sectoral agreements, and institutions for finance and investment and capacity building.\n",
      "Chapter 15 (Investment and finance) assesses scenarios of, and needs for, mitigation investment and financial flows, and the means of mobilising climate finance at the national and sub-national levels.\n",
      "Chapter 16 (Innovation, technology development and transfer) examines the role of innovation, technology development, diffusion and transfer in contributing to sustainable development and the aims of the Paris Agreement.\n",
      "It addresses specific challenges in emerging economies and least developed countries.The Assessment Process This WG III contribution to the AR6 has been prepared in accordance with IPCC rules and procedures.\n",
      "A scoping meeting was held in May 2017 and the outlines for the contributions of the three WGs were approved at the 46th Session of the Panel in September 2017.\n",
      "Governments and IPCC observer organisations nominated experts for the author teams.\n",
      "The team of 199 Coordinating Lead Authors and Lead Authors, plus 38 Review Editors, selected by the WG III Bureau, was accepted at the 55th Session of the IPCC Bureau in January 2018.\n",

      "Recent Developments and Current Trends 6 Net GHG emissions in this report refer to releases of greenhouse gases from anthropogenic sources minus removals by anthropogenic sinks, for those species of gases that are reported under the common reporting format of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (CO 2-FFI); net CO 2 emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO 2-LULUCF); methane (CH 4); nitrous oxide (N 2O); and fluorinated gases (F-gases) comprising hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6), as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3).\n",
      "Different datasets for GHG emissions exist, with varying time horizons and coverage of sectors and gases, including some that go back to 1850.\n",
      "In this report, GHG emissions are assessed from 1990, and CO 2 sometimes also from 1850.\n",
      "Reasons for this include data availability and robustness, scope of the assessed literature, and the differing warming impacts of non-CO 2 gases over time.\n",
      "7 GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different greenhouse gases in a common unit.\n",
      "Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO 2-equivalent (CO 2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to the AR6.\n",
      "The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the analysis, and all GHG emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions.\n",
      "{Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2, Supplementary Material 2.SM.3, Box TS.2; AR6 WGI Chapter 7 Supplementary Material} 8 In this SPM, uncertainty in historic GHG emissions is reported using 90% uncertainty intervals unless stated otherwise.\n",
      "GHG emission levels are rounded to two significant digits; as a consequence, small differences in sums due to rounding may occur.\n",
      "9 Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic.\n",
      "Currently, net CO 2 fluxes from land reported by global bookkeeping models used here are estimated to be about 5.5 GtCO 2 yr–1 higher than the aggregate global net emissions based on national GHG inventories.\n",
      "This difference, which has been considered in the literature, mainly reflects differences in how anthropogenic forest sinks and areas of managed land are defined.\n",
      "Other reasons for this difference, which are more difficult to quantify, can arise from the limited representation of land management in global models and varying levels of accuracy and completeness of estimated LULUCF fluxes in national GHG inventories.\n",
      "Neither method is inherently preferable.\n",
      "Even when the same methodological approach is applied, the large uncertainty of CO 2-LULUCF emissions can lead to substantial revisions to estimated emissions.\n",

      "It builds on previous IPCC reports, including the WGIII contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the three Special Reports of the Sixth Assessment cycle on: Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (SRCCL); and the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC).1 The report assesses new literature, methodological and recent developments, and changes in approaches towards climate change mitigation since the IPCC AR5 report was published in 2014.\n",
      "The global science and policy landscape on climate change mitigation has evolved since AR5.\n",
      "The development of the literature reflects, among other factors, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the outcomes of its Kyoto Protocol and the goals of the Paris Agreement {13, 14, 15}, and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development {1, 4, 17}.\n",
      "Literature further highlights the growing role of non-state and sub-national actors in the global effort to address climate change, including cities, businesses, citizens, transnational initiatives and public-private entities {5, 8, 13}.\n",
      "It draws attention to the decreasing cost of some low-emission technologies {2, 6, 12} and the evolving role of international cooperation {14}, finance {15} and innovation {16}.\n",
      "Emerging literature examines the global spread of climate policies, strengthened mitigation actions in developing countries, sustained reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in some developed countries and the continuing challenges for mitigation.\n",
      "{2, 13} There are ever closer linkages between climate change mitigation, development pathways and the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n",
      "Development pathways largely drive GHG emissions and hence shape the mitigation challenge and the portfolio of available responses {4}.\n",
      "The co-benefits and risks of mitigation responses also differ according to stages of development and national capabilities {1, 2, 3, 4, 13}.\n",
      "Climate change mitigation framed in the context of sustainable development, equity, and poverty eradication, and rooted in the development aspirations of the society within which they take place, will be more acceptable, durable and effective.\n",
      "{1, 4, 17} This report includes new assessment approaches that go beyond those evaluated in the previous IPCC WGIII reports.\n",
      "In addition to sectoral and systems chapters {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}, this report includes, for the first time, chapters dedicated to cross-sectoral perspectives {12}, demand, services and social aspects of mitigation (Box TS.11) {5}, and innovation, technology development and transfer {16}.\n",

      "Collaboration between the IPCC Working Groups is reflected in Cross-Working Group boxes which address topics such as the economic benefits from avoided impacts along mitigation pathways {Cross-Working Group Box 1 in Chapter 3}, climate change and urban areas {Cross-Working Group Box 2 in Chapter 8}, mitigation and adaptation through the bioeconomy {Cross-Working Group Box 3 in Chapter 12} and Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) {Cross-Working Group Box 4 in Chapter 14}.\n",
      "This assessment also gives greater attention than AR5 to social, economic and environmental dimensions of mitigation actions, and institutional, legal and financial aspects.\n",
      "{5, 13, 14, 15} The report draws from literature on broad and diverse analytic frameworks across multiple disciplines.\n",
      "These include, inter alia: economic and environmental efficiency {1}; ethics and equity {4, 5, 17}; innovation and the dynamics of socio-technical transitions {16}; and socio-political-institutional frameworks {1, 5, 13, 14, 17}.\n",

      "Meeting the long-term temperature goal in the Paris Agreement, however, implies a rapid inflection in GHG emission trends and accelerating decline towards ‘net zero’.\n",
      "This is implausible without urgent and ambitious action at all scales.\n",
      "{1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, Chapters 3 and 4} Effective and equitable climate policies are largely compatible with the broader goal of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty as enshrined in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notwithstanding trade-offs in some cases (high confidence).\n",
      "Taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts is one of the 17 SDGs (SDG 13).\n",
      "However, climate change mitigation also has synergies and/or trade-offs with many other SDGs.\n",
      "There has been a strong relationship between development and GHG emissions, as historically both per-capita and absolute emissions have risen with industrialisation.\n",
      "However, recent evidence shows countries can grow their economies while reducing emissions.\n",
      "Countries have different priorities in achieving the SDGs and reducing emissions as informed by their respective national conditions and capabilities.\n",
      "Given the differences in GHG emissions contributions, degree of vulnerability and impacts, as well as capacities within and between nations, equity and justice are important considerations for effective climate policy and for securing national and international support for deep decarbonisation.\n",
      "Achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty would involve effective and equitable climate policies at all levels from local to global scale.\n",
      "Failure to address questions of equity and justice over time can undermine social cohesion and stability.\n",
      "International cooperation can enhance efforts to achieve ambitious global climate mitigation in the context of sustainable development.\n",
      "Pathways that illustrate movement towards fulfilling the SDGs are shown in Figure TS.1.\n",

      "Drivers for, and constraints on, low-carbon societal transitions comprise economic and technological factors (the means by which services such as food, heating and shelter are provided and for whom, the emissions intensity of traded products, finance and investment), socio-political issues (political economy, equity and fairness, social innovation and behaviour change), and institutional factors (legal framework and institutions, and the quality of international cooperation).\n",
      "In addition to being deeply intertwined, all the factors matter to varying degrees, depending on the prevailing social, economic, cultural and political context.\n",
      "They often both drive and inhibit transitions at the same time, within and across different scales.\n",
      "The development and deployment of innovative technologies and systems at scale are important for achieving deep decarbonisation, and in recent years, the cost of several low-carbon technologies has declined sharply as deployment has risen rapidly.\n",
      "(Figure TS.7) {1.3, 1.4, Chapters 2, 4, 5, 13,14} Accelerating mitigation to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system will require the integration of broadened assessment frameworks and tools that combine multiple perspectives, applied in a context of multi-level governance (high confidence).\n",
      "Analysing a challenge on the scale of fully decarbonising our economies entails integration of multiple analytic frameworks.\n",
      "Approaches to risk assessment and resilience, established across IPCC Working Groups, are complemented by frameworks for probing the challenges in implementing mitigation.\n",
      "Aggregate frameworks include cost-effectiveness analysis towards given objectives, and cost-benefit analysis, both of which have been developing to take fuller account of advances in understanding risks and innovation, the dynamics of sectors and systems and of climate impacts, and welfare economic theory including growing consensus on long-term discounting.\n",
      "Ethical frameworks consider the fairness of processes and outcomes which can help ameliorate distributional impacts across income groups, countries and generations.\n",
      "Transition and transformation frameworks explain and evaluate the dynamics of transitions to low-carbon systems arising from interactions amongst levels.\n",

      "GHG emission metrics provide simplified information about the effect that emissions of different gases have on global temperature or other aspects of climate, usually expressed relative to the effect of emitting CO 2.9 This information can support choices about priorities, trade-offs and synergies in mitigation policies and emission targets for non-CO 2 gases relative to CO 2 as well as baskets of gases expressed in CO 2-eq.\n",
      "The choice of metric can affect the timing and emphasis placed on reducing emissions of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) relative to CO 2 within multi-gas abatement strategies as well as the costs of such strategies.\n",
      "Different metric choices can also alter the time at which net zero GHG emissions are calculated to be reached for any given emissions scenario.\n",
      "A wide range of GHG emission metrics has been published in the scientific literature, which differ in terms of: (i) the key measure of climate change they consider, (ii) whether they consider climate outcomes for a specified point in time or integrated over a specified time horizon, (iii) the time horizon over which the metric is applied, (iv) whether they apply to a single emission pulse, to emissions sustained over a period of time, or to a combination of both, and (v) whether they consider the climate effect from an emission compared to the absence of that emission, or compared to a reference emissions level or climate state.\n",
      "{Annex II} Parties to the Paris Agreement decided to report aggregated emissions and removals (expressed as CO 2-eq) based on the Global Warming Potential (GWP) with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) using values from IPCC AR5 or from a subsequent IPCC report as agreed upon by the CMA,10 and to account for future Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in accordance with this approach.\n",
      "Parties may also report supplemental information on aggregate emissions and removals, expressed as CO 2-eq, using other GHG emission metrics assessed by the IPCC.\n",
      "The WGIII contribution to AR6 uses updated GWP100 values from AR6 WGI to report aggregate emissions and removals unless stated otherwise.\n",
      "These reflect updated scientific understanding of the response of the climate system to emissions of different gases and include a methodological update to incorporate climate-carbon cycle feedbacks associated with the emission of non-CO 2 gases (see Annex II.II.8 for a list of GWP100 metric values).\n",
      "The choice of GWP100 was made inter alia for consistency with decisions under the Rulebook for the Paris Agreement and because it is the dominant metric used in the literature assessed by WGIII.\n",
      "Furthermore, for mitigation pathways that limit global warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, using GWP100 to inform cost-effective abatement choices between gases would achieve such long-term temperature goals at close to least global cost within a few percent (high confidence).\n",
      "However, GWP100 is not well-suited to estimate the cumulative effect on climate from sustained SLCF emissions and the resulting warming at specific points in time.\n",
      "This is because the warming caused by an individual SLCF emission pulse is not permanent, and hence, unlike CO 2, the warming from successive SLCF emission pulses over multiple decades or centuries depends mostly on their ongoing rate of emissions rather than cumulative emissions.\n",
      "Recently developed step/pulse metrics such as the CGTP (combined global temperature change potential) and GWP* (referred to as GWP-star and indicated by an asterisk) recognise that a sustained increase/decrease in the rate of SLCF emissions has indeed a similar effect on global surface temperature as one-off emission/ removal of CO 2.\n",
      "These metrics use this relationship to calculate the CO 2 emissions or removals that would result in roughly the same temperature change as a sustained change in the rate of SLCF emissions (CGTP) over a given time period, or as a varying time series of CH 4 emissions (GWP*).\n",
      "IFrom a mitigation perspective, this makes these metrics well-suited in principle to estimate the effect on the remaining carbon budget from more, or less, ambitious SLCF mitigation over multiple decades compared to a given reference scenario (high confidence).\n",

      "There is compelling evidence to show that continuing along existing development pathways will not achieve rapid and deep emission reductions.\n",

      "Policies to shift development pathways, on the other hand, make mitigation policies more effective.\n",
      "Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between sustainable development objectives and mitigation.\n",

      "Integrated policies can support the creation of synergies between action to combat climate change and its impacts (SDG 13 – climate action) and other SDGs.\n",
      "For example, when measures promoting walkable urban areas are combined with electrification and clean renewable energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained.\n",
      "These include reduced pressures on agricultural land from reduced urban growth, health co-benefits from cleaner air, and benefits from enhanced mobility {8.2, 8.4, 4.4.1}.\n",
      "Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through improved access to clean fuels also deliver significant health benefits.\n",

      "Shifting development paths is complex.\n",
      "Changes that involve ‘dissimilar, unfamiliar and more complex science-based components’ take more time, acceptance and legitimation and involve complex social learning, even when they promise large gains.\n",
      "Despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-makers, citizens, the private sector, and social stakeholders.\n",

      "Yet since countries differ in starting points (e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and historical backgrounds, they have different urgent needs in terms of facilitating the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and, therefore, give different priorities {4.3.2, 17.1}.\n",
      "The appropriate set of policies to shift development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities.\n",
      "Shifting development pathways towards sustainability needs to be supported by multilateral partnerships to strengthen suitable capacity, technological innovation (TS.6.5), and financial flows (TS.6.4).\n",
      "The international community can play a particularly key role by helping ensure the necessary broad participation in climate-mitigation efforts, including by countries at different development levels, through sustained support for policies and partnerships that support shifting development pathways towards sustainability while promoting equity and being mindful of different transition capacities.\n",

      "The concept has evolved, becoming prominent in the United States of America in 1980, related to environmental regulations that resulted in job losses from highly polluting industries.\n",
      "Traced from a purely labour movement, trade union space, the Just Transition framework emphasises that decent work and environmental protection are not incompatible.\n",
      "During COP 24, with the Just Transition Silesia Declaration, the concept gained in recognition and was signed by 56 heads of state.\n",
      "Implicit in a Just Transition is the notion of well-being, equity and justice – the realisation that transitions are inherently disruptive and deliberate effort may be required to ensure communities dependent on fossil-fuel based economies and industries do not suffer disproportionately {Chapter 4}.\n",
      "‘Just Transitions’ are integral to the European Union as mentioned in the EU Green Deal, the Scottish Government’s development plans and other national low-carbon transition strategies.\n",

      "There is no certainty on how energy systems will recover post- COVID-19.\n",
      "However, ‘Just Transitions’ will have equity implications if stimulus packages are implemented without due regard for the differentiated scales and speeds and national and regional contexts, especially in the context of developing countries.\n",
      "A Just Transition entails targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and other non-state authorities to ensure that any negative social, environmental, or economic impacts of economy-wide transitions are minimised, whilst benefits are maximised for those disproportionally affected.\n",
      "These proactive measures include eradication of poverty, regulating prosperity and creating jobs in ‘green’ sectors.\n",
      "In addition, governments, polluting industries, corporations, and those more able to pay higher associated taxes, can pay for transition costs by providing a welfare safety net and adequate compensation to people, communities, and regions that have been impacted by pollution, or are marginalised, or are negatively impacted by a transition from a high- to low-carbon economy and society.\n",
